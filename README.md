This is the final project for my GDM Class MVP Development This an entry to discuss my progress and Document My Process. As I do in every game design project I feel like I bit off more than I can chew. after discussions with my professor, I decided on a simpler version of the game. It will be a tower defense game with placable towers, obstacles, and a home base to defend. A problem I have run into again is when I hit a roadblock I tend to just put whatever is broken down and move on. This means I don't get stuck but it also means that I normally have a bunch of thing that don't work or half work when I take a step back and look at the project. I currently have a simple arena with roads that the enemies will use to reach the home base once I figure out how the nav mesh works. I also have the working spawners that spawn enemies but that are currently falling. I also built a script for my turrets to shoot any EnemyFighter Prefabs that get close but I can currently test that they work. I did test it firing in one direction which did work so I am hopeful. Lastly i made layers for each major thing but not sure if that was done correctly. Af of now this is my update for my MVP
