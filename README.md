⚔️ VoltGuard – A 2D Tower Defense Game
Welcome to VoltGuard, a unique take on the tower defense genre built as a final project for GDM6. In this 2D game, players must defend a central base from waves of enemies using energy-powered turrets — with a twist. Players actively manage and distribute charge, making every second of survival a challenge in strategy and resource management.

🎮 Game Overview
Unlike traditional tower defense games, this game features active player involvement. While turrets auto-target enemies, they require charge to keep firing. Players must collect and manage energy, recharge turrets manually, and even choose whether to fire manually when the pressure ramps up.

The goal is simple: Defend your home base for as long as you can.

🔧 Core Mechanics
Energy/Charge System
Earn credits by defeating enemies, then recharge your base, and use that charge to power turrets.

Active Turret Management
Turrets drain charge over time. You decide which ones to prioritize based on enemy paths and strategy.

Manual Intervention
Players can fire manually using charge when enemies overwhelm the turrets.

Progressive Difficulty
Enemies get faster and stronger over time, pushing the player to adapt or be overwhelmed.
